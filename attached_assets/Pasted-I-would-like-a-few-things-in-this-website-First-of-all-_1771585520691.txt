I would like a few things in this website. First of all, I will be sharing the logo of the website, which you need to implement instead of the mounted logo on the website, which is just S and then Student Voice. Next, the website is quite good and you need to tell me like what link you have mounted in the scheduler demo button. When I click the scheduler demo button, then where it takes me, it should take me to the contact information to just like if someone is there who is trying to figure it out how these things works, then he should fill his contact detail and we can be connected with him. Okay, so next is why Student Voice, that's great, administration, departmental heads, students, and all those things. Then powerful features for modern institutions, all those things are quite good. Real-time dashboard and numbers reporting, smart analysis, right, actionable reports, okay. Nice. Now how it works is, student submit, you analyze, and campus improves, right, very good. Then there is a section where there is a statement from some Dr. Sahara Chen, so you need to erase that one. You should completely erase that particular slide. Then there is ready to foster a happier campus. So this quite light, it is quite not visible with the background, so keep the background white, but change the font colors, keep it black or dark blue or violet kind of, right. Then request demo and get a demo page is quite good. And then there are frequently asked questions, so it's quite good. Next, you need to tell me what buttons do I need to mount links for. Like if I click a button, then where it takes me. I need to make it industry-grade ready and this is the front page of what I will be selling to the universities or colleges, how they will be contacting me and all, right. So we should make this quite realistic and industry-grade. So the first iteration was good. Now in the second iteration, make this particular changes which I told you. And then I will let you know if there is something else to be changed in the website. Otherwise, all the things are good and keep it responsive.
