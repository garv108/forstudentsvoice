👤 Role & Goal
You are an expert front-end developer using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Your task is to build a modern, inspiring, and conversion-focused single-page landing page for a SaaS platform named StudentVoice.

🎯 Core Concept
StudentVoice is a "Proactive Student Feedback System" sold directly to colleges and universities. It is NOT a public complaint board. It is a professional tool that gives administrators a real-time dashboard to understand student concerns, improve campus life, and prevent small issues from escalating. The tone is empowering, professional, and solutions-oriented.

🎨 Design & UX Requirements

Color Palette: Use a professional, trustworthy palette. Primary color: deep blue (#2563eb). Neutral backgrounds (off-whites, light grays #f9fafb). Accents: supportive green (#10b981) for positive actions, cautious amber (#f59e0b) for highlights. Avoid pure black, stark white, or overly bright neon colors.

Typography: Use clean, modern fonts (Inter or system font stack). Clear hierarchy with ample whitespace.

3D/Interactive Elements: Integrate 2-3 subtle, lightweight 3D elements to add sophistication without slowing the page. Examples:

A floating, slowly rotating 3D dashboard icon in the hero section (like a data visualization).

Tilt-effect or gentle floating animation on key feature cards.

A 3D pie chart or graph element in the data section that morphs on scroll.

Layout: Single-page scroll with clear sections. It must feel premium.

📝 Page Sections & Content Flow
Create these sections in order:

Sticky Navigation Bar

Logo: StudentVoice (bold, primary color).

Menu: Home, Features, How It Works, FAQ.

Two buttons: Sign In (outline), Get Started (solid, primary). The Sign In button links directly to: https://students-voice-bay.vercel.app/login. Get Started scrolls to the CTA.

Hero Section

Headline: Transform Student Feedback into Actionable Insight.

Sub-headline: StudentVoice gives your institution a real-time dashboard to understand campus sentiment, address concerns proactively, and build a better student experience.

Primary Button: Schedule a Demo (links to CTA).

Secondary Button: View Features (scrolls to Features).

Visual: Include the 3D floating dashboard icon.

Value Proposition (3-column)

Title: Why StudentVoice?

Three cards with icons (use tilt/hover effect):

For Administrators: Gain a clear, real-time view of campus climate and student needs.

For Department Heads: Identify trends and pain points specific to your faculty or cohort.

For Students: A trusted, structured channel to be heard, leading to tangible improvements.

Features Section

Title: Powerful Features for Modern Institutions

2x2 grid:

Real-Time Dashboard: Monitor feedback trends as they happen.

Anonymous & Safe Reporting: Secure, anonymized channels for confident feedback.

Smart Analytics: AI-powered insights categorize and prioritize issues.

Actionable Reports: Generate detailed reports for stakeholders with one click.

Include a small, non-intrusive 3D graph graphic in the background.

How It Works (3 Steps)

Simple, numbered steps:

Students Submit: Feedback via a simple, accessible web portal.

You Analyze: Issues are categorized on your private dashboard.

Campus Improves: Make data-driven decisions to enhance student life.

⚙️ Technical Implementation Requirements

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for all styling. No Sass or CSS modules.

Interactivity: Use framer-motion for animations and card tilt.

Form: Simple onSubmit handler that console.log data. No backend.

Deployment Ready: Code must be standalone. Do not use Replit-specific packages. Use standard npm imports.

🔗 Critical Integration Note
This is a static marketing site. Its sole purpose is to generate demo leads and funnel users to the main application.

The Sign In buttons (Navbar and CTA section) must link directly to https://students-voice-bay.vercel.app/login.

The Get Started button scrolls to the demo form.

DO NOT implement authentication (Clerk) or app logic here.

🚫 Final Command
Do not write placeholder code or pseudocode. Generate the complete, working, production-ready code for this landing page as specified. The output should be a full Next.js project structure I can immediately run with npm install && npm run dev.
